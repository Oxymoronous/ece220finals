Public, Private, Protected (source geeksforgeeks.org)

1. Public
- All class members declared under public will be available to other classes 
and functions

2. Private
- Only member functions or the friend functions are allowed to access the private
data members
- not allowed to access directly by any object/function outside the class

3. Protected
- Similar to private in the sense that protected members also cannot be accessed 
outside of its class unless with the help of a friend class
- Protected members can be accessed by derived class

4. Friend class/functions
- Friends can access BOTH private and protected members of a class if it is declared
as a friend of that class
